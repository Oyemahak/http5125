# Back-End Web Development 1

This repository contains the code and assignments for my **Back-End Web Development 1** course. In this course, I am learning **C#** and how to build server-side applications using this language. The focus is on understanding object-oriented programming, data structures, and building scalable back-end solutions.

### Technologies used:
